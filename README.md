# Binary-Array-List
List container of arrays of doubling size

This is a templated class which is implemented as a combination of a linked list and vector. It includes all features of both, with a running time often averaged or optimal running time. The container will be implemented as a vector of vectors. This is because vectors are implemented as a header pointing at an array of continguous memory. The only reason to use linked list was for the disjointed memory, but the header pointer takes care of that.

As features are implemented their usage, running time, and implmentation details will be posted here.
